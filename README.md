## Overview

**InsightVio** is an open-source toolkit designed to bring clarity to machine learning models used in healthcare, finance, and other critical fields. In an era where black-box AI dominates, InsightVio focuses on **transparency**, **trust**, and **human-understandable explanations**.

This project aims to bridge the gap between technical AI predictions and real-world decision-makers—such as doctors, regulators, and researchers—by visually and logically explaining how predictions are made.
