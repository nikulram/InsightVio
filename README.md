# InsightVio

### A Transparent Visual AI Toolkit for Interpretable Decision Support

**Author:** Nikul Ram  
**Status:** Public Open Source Project – Under Active Development  
**License:** MIT  
**Repository:** https://github.com/nikulram/InsightVio

---

## Overview

**InsightVio** is an open-source Python toolkit for transforming machine learning model predictions into human-understandable insights. Built with a mission to improve AI **transparency**, **trust**, and **decision support**, InsightVio serves domains where interpretability matters most—such as **healthcare**, **finance**, and **regulatory systems**.

This project bridges the gap between complex AI logic and real-world practitioners by combining established explainable AI tools (like SHAP and LIME) with custom-built visualizers and interpretable logic paths.

---

## Key Features

- **Visual Explanation Engine**  
  Converts AI decisions into intuitive visual logic trees and annotated flowcharts.

- **Built-in Explainable AI (XAI) Methods**  
  Integrates SHAP and LIME for feature impact analysis and interpretable outputs.

- **Healthcare Ready (Phase 1)**  
  Preconfigured to work with Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, and COVID-19 datasets.

- **Modular & Research-Friendly**  
  Notebook-ready, lightweight, and open for research extensions.

- **Production-Focused Roadmap**  
  API-ready and designed for clinical or regulatory embedding.

---

## Target Audience

- AI Researchers and Interpretable ML Enthusiasts  
- Healthcare Analysts and Medical AI Practitioners  
- Ethics & Governance Professionals  
- Graduate / PhD Students in AI, Bioinformatics, or Policy  
- Contributors aiming for meaningful open-source impact

---

## Installation

Install Python packages:

pip install shap lime matplotlib scikit-learn pandas numpy


Recommended: Python 3.9 or newer.


---

## Roadmap

InsightVio is being developed in clearly defined, research-grade milestones:

- **Phase 1** – Core Visual Explanation Toolkit (SHAP + LIME) with Medical Datasets (Completed)
- **Phase 2** – Regression model support + Custom interpretable modules (Next)
- **Phase 3** – Real-time Web API & Streamlit-based Deployment UI (In Progress)
- **Phase 4** – Academic Submission to IEEE Xplore or NeurIPS XAI Track
- **Phase 5** – Auto-generated decision policies & clinical trial interpretability (Final Stage)

---

## Phase 1 Use Case: Healthcare AI

InsightVio currently supports key healthcare datasets for classification:

**Currently Integrated:**
- (Note : Was Converted DATA to .csv)
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis) – `load_breast_cancer()` from sklearn
- Parkinson’s Disease Classification – [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons)
- Credit Card Fraud Detection – [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

**Coming Soon:**
- Cleveland Heart Disease
- COVID-19 Symptoms & Mortality Outcomes
- Upload-your-own-data from GUI or CLI

> All datasets used are open-source and publicly available. Final README will include DOIs and citations.
